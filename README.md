Every day, many passengers on buses miss their stops due to having a lack of focus and sleeping on the bus. In my subjective opinion, this can be very frustrating and could cause a passenger to have a worse experience using public transport. Along with this, missing the bus stop could cause delays in getting to work or school, degrading a consumerâ€™s quality of work. To avoid this problem, a solution needs to be created which alerts the user of an incoming stop and I plan to do that in my NEA.
